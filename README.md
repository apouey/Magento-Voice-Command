Magento-Voice-Command
=====================

Magento Administration By Voice Commands

Using annyang javascript Library

Note :

Chrome's implementation of SpeechRecognition behaves differently based on the protocol used:

- `https://` Asks for permission once and remembers the choice.

- `http://`  Asks for permission repeatedly **on every page load**. Results are also returned significantly slower in HTTP.

For a great user experience, don't compromise on anything less than HTTPS (an SSL certificate can be as cheap as $5).
